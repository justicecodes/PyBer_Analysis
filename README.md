# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

### Goal of Analysis: Using rideshare data gathered from 2019, charts were created to visualize differences in drivers, fares, and number of rides depending on the city type. A multiple-line graph  shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Summary: 
Recommendations for the Pyber CEO
- Incentivize more drivers to join the company in suburban regions. A higher percent of rides comes from that city type although there is a disproportionately low number of drivers when comparing the pie charts. 
- Fares are much higher in rural areas. Analyze further causes of this difference - are the rides longer distances or longer time, or both? Consider incentivizing more drivers in these areas too so there is more availability and drivers do not have to go as far to pick up riders. 
- The average fares in March, April and July are highest. Consider providing a contest for writing reviews or other small incentive for riders to continue to request rides in these months despite higher prices.
