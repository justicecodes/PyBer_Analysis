# PyBer_Analysis

### Goal of Analysis: 
Using rideshare data gathered from 2019, charts were created to visualize differences in drivers, fares, and number of rides depending on the city type. A multiple-line graph  shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

### Results:
- The graph below compares the average fare of each ride to the total number of rides per city. The size of each circle represents the number of rides per city. An obvious trend can be noted that urban cities have a higher number of rides per city with much lower fares compared to suburban cities and much different than rural cities.

- The graph and table below confirm the claim that as the number of rides increases, seen in urban cities vs. rural cities, the fare decreases.  The average fare for a ride in an urban city is $10 higher than the average fare in a rural city.

- The number of drivers and total rides is much higher for urban areas as well, as they are typically more densely populated.

- Despite a lower average fare per ride, the majority of the total fares for all rides comes from urban cities. It would make sense for Pyber to continue to promote rides at lower prices in urban areas because the overall profit is still higher. 
- From this data, however, you can tell that there are more drivers in urban areas by percent, compared to other pie charts, which could mean that these drivers are making less overall for themselves. Pyber could try to increase the number of drivers in suburban and rural cities for higher driver satisfaction.

- This final chart shows the total fare collected per week for urban, suburban, and rural cities. Urban cities make more money per week than the other city types combined for every week. This chart confirms the claims made by the other types of charts.

### Summary: 
Recommendations for the Pyber CEO
- Incentivize more drivers to join the company in suburban regions. A higher percent of rides comes from that city type although there is a disproportionately low number of drivers when comparing the pie charts. 
- Fares are much higher in rural areas. Analyze further causes of this difference - are the rides longer distances or longer time, or both? Consider incentivizing more drivers in these areas too so there is more availability and drivers do not have to go as far to pick up riders. 
- The average fares in March, April and July are highest. Consider providing a contest for writing reviews or other small incentive for riders to continue to request rides in these months despite higher prices.
